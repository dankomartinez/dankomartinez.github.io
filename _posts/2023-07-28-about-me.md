My extracurricular activities during the coursing of my degree were:
- Assisting to Congresses with teammmates.
- Sharping my engineering tools like Solidworks, Mathematica. 
- Learning about programming.

And lately I'm interested in learning tools like PowerBI, Excel, SQL, tableau  and Data Engineering techniques besides improving my languages skills.
